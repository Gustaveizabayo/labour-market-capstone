# Labour Market Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes labour market data to identify key trends, patterns, and insights.  
It is part of my capstone work in learning **Python, data analysis, and visualization**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and clean labour market datasets.
- Explore employment, unemployment, and income distribution trends.
- Apply **Python libraries** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) for analysis.
- Build visualizations and reports to explain findings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
